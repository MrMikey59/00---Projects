# HTML: Hypertext Markup Language

The HTML element is the Document container.  All other elements should be within these tags.
The simplest version:
```html
<HTML>
```

The most common version:
```html
<HTML dir="ltr" lang="en>
```
This one includes writing direction (Left to Right) and a language designation (English).
