# Excel Addins


## Activating Excel Add-ins in Excel 2007 and 2010
Two important Excel add-ins are Solver and Analysis ToolPak. Both of these are a part of Excel but must be activated or loaded before you can use them the first time. To load these add-ins, follow these steps (step 1a is for Excel 2010 users and step 1b is for Excel 2007 users):
1.	For Excel 2010, click the File tab, click Options, and then click Add-Ins. For Excel 2007, click the Microsoft Office button, click Excel Options, and then click Add-Ins.
2.	In the Manage box, select Excel Add-Ins and click Go.
3.	Check the boxes next to Analysis ToolPak and Solver Add-In, and then click OK.

The Data tab now displays Solver and Data Analysis every time Excel is started.
