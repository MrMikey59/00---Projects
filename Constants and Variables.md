# Constants and Variables

#### Python Identifiers (Names)

* The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet (upper or lowercase) or an underscore ('_').
* The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (upper or lowercase), underscores ('_') or digits (0-9).
* Identifier names are case-sensitive.
* Use a double underscore to start a PRIVATE variable name.
* Use a single underscore to start a semi-private variable name.

#### Declare Constant
VBScript:  
```vbscript
{Public | Private | Dim } <varName> [As <Type>]
```

#### Declare Variables
VBScript:  
```vbscript
Const <Name> [As <Type> ]= <Value>
```
