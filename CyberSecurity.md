## Prevent Cryptocurrency Mining
Install the No Coin extension, available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. Itâ€™s open source, is the most popular extension of its type, and does a great job of blocking Coin Hive and other similar cryptocurrency miners.  

## Make the Internet Safer and More Secure 
Followthese simple tips:
-	**Enable stronger authentication on Websites**.  Always enable stronger authentication for an extra layer of security beyond the password that is available on most major email, social media and financial accounts.  Stronger authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication that can use a one-time code texted to a mobile device) helps verify that a user has authorized access to an online account.   
-	**Make your passwords long & strong** when you use passwords. Use complex passwords with a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters.  Use unique passwords for different accounts.  
-	**When in doubt, throw it out**.  Links in email and online posts are often the way cyber criminals compromise your computer.  If it looks suspicious (even if you know the source), delete it.  
-	**Share with care**.  Limit the amount of personal information you share online and use privacy settings to avoid sharing information widely.  
-	**Keep a clean machine**.  Update the security software, operating system, and web browser on all of your Internet-connected devices.  Keeping your security software up to date will prevent attackers from taking advantage of known vulnerabilities.  
-	**Back it up**.  Make electronic and physical back-ups or copies of all your important work.  Data can be lost in many ways including computer malfunctions, malware, theft, viruses, and accidental deletion.  

## Spyware & Adware
1.	When visiting web sites, do not click on the pop up ads that appear. Often Spyware will install once a user clicks on a link within a pop up window. Close all pop up windows by clicking on the "X" in the top right hand corner of the pop up window. 
2.	Be sure to read and completely understand any "User Agreements" that appear on web sites before responding "I Agree". 
3.	To exit unfamiliar web sites you may have been redirected to, click on the "X" in the upper right hand corner to close the browser window. Users are strongly encouraged not to click anywhere within the browser window, as this may result in unintentional installation of Spyware on your NMCI workstation.
