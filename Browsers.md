```dos
"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" -inprivate https://portal.apps.mil/
```

**InPrivate** browsing is a private browsing mode in which no browsing history, download history, cookies and site data, and form fill data are remembered. Microsoft Edge saves downloaded files as well as any new favorites created while browsing InPrivate. By default, while browsing InPrivate, Microsoft does not collect any info about websites you visit for product improvement purposes. Your school, workplace, or internet service provider may still be able to see your browsing activity. Browsing data for the specific InPrivate session is cleared after all InPrivate windows are closed.
