# tar - The Archiver

```shell
tar -cvzf %s %s -X /home/swaroop/excludes.txt' % (target, ' '.join(srcdir))
```  

The options are explained below.
•	-c indicates creation of an archive.
•	-v indicates verbose i.e. the command should be more talkative.
•	-z indicates the gzip filter should be used.
•	-f indicates force in creation of archive i.e. it should replace if there is a file by the same name already.
•	-X indicates a file which contains a list of filenames which must be excluded from the backup. For example, you can specify *~ in this file to not include any filenames ending with ~ in the backup.
