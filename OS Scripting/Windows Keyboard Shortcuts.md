## Manage app and Explorer windows with keyboard shortcuts
Arranging windows on the screen is an essential task for any operation that involves moving or copying files between Explorer windows, copying text and graphics from one program window to another, or comparing different versions of a document or spreadsheet.  
If you find yourself doing any of those tasks regularly, it pays to learn a handful of keyboard shortcuts that clear away extraneous windows and then snap individual windows into position. With the distractions removed, you can now snap individual windows to either side of the display, using the shortcut `WINDOW + LEFT/RIGHT ARROW`. Press this combination once to position the current window so it occupies the left or right half of the display and then repeat the process with the second window, using the opposite keyboard shortcut.  
If you have multiple monitors, you can keep pressing that key combination to move through the different snap permutations until you have every window arranged exactly as you like.  

## Manage Windows Without Using the Mouse
What do you do when you know a program window is open but its title bar is not visible on the screen? That phenomenon is fortunately rare, but it's frustrating when it happens. It can occur, for example, when you're switching from an external monitor to the built-in display on a laptop.  
The secret of recovery relies on an old, mostly forgotten feature that's still part of every resizable window: the control menu. This menu features a handful of window-management commands: Restore, Move, Size, Minimize, Maximize, and Close.  
If the title bar of the window is invisible, you can use the Move command and a few keystrokes to nudge it back into view.  
Start by using `[ALT]+[TAB]` to select the invisible window. Then press `[ALT]+[SPACEBAR]` to open the control menu and tap M to select the Move command. Now tap the arrow keys to move the window until the title bar is visible. (Most often, the hidden window is off to the right and/or below the main display, so try the Left and Up arrow keys first.)  
Once the title bar is visible, you can tap Esc to cancel the Move command and then use your mouse to move the formerly hidden window to the desired position.
